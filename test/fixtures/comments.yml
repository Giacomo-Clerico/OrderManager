# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one:
  body: "Sample comment"
  order_id: orders(:one).id
# column: value
#
two:
  body: "Sample comment 2"
  order_id: orders(:two).id
# column: value
